# AuDeFi

The music royalty business has been hindered by a lack of transparency, industry standards, 
and technological adoption to protect artists and ensure proper compensation for 
intellectual property. 

As a result, hundreds of millions, 
if not billions of dollars have been lost or misallocatedâ€”money properly owed to artists.

Artists often receive a small percentage of the revenue generated by their music, especially on streaming platforms. After accounting for record labels, publishers, and other intermediaries, artists might only receive a fraction of the total earnings.

The global distribution of music involves a complex web of record labels, publishers, distributors, collection societies, and streaming platforms. Each entity takes a portion of the revenue before it reaches the artist, leading to concerns about fair compensation.

# Our Next Gen Solution

Blockchain-based royalty app has the potential to address several longstanding issues in the music industry, primarily related to transparency, accountability, and fairness.

The smart contract capabilities could enable automated royalty payments based on predefined terms. Artists and rights holders could receive their fair share of revenue directly and instantly whenever their music is streamed, downloaded, or used, eliminating the delays and intermediaries in traditional payment systems.

Blockchain's inherent security features can help protect intellectual property rights by providing a tamper-proof record of ownership and usage rights. This could help prevent unauthorized use of music and ensure that artists are appropriately compensated for their work.

Blockchain's traceability can enhance the tracking of song usage and attributions, making it easier to monitor when and where a song is played. This transparency can help prevent unauthorized use and ensure that appropriate royalties are paid for each play.

# Tokenization of Music & Royalty Smart Contracts


Artists create digital representations of their music as NFTs on a blockchain platform. Each NFT is unique and represents a specific piece of music.

Royalty Smart Contracts:
Smart contracts are programmed to automatically distribute royalties to NFT holders based on predefined terms. When the music generates revenue, such as through streaming, sales, or licensing, the smart contract ensures that the corresponding royalties are distributed to the NFT holders.

## How Musicians Benefit

By embracing technology and simplifying the standards of royalty payments, musicians will benefit from a sustainable infrastructure that ensures proper compensation for their work. In addition, the concept helps break down opaque barriers in the industry, creating greater transparency among all participants in the industry.

Best of all, increases in streaming revenue will be a boon for artists as they gain greater access to capital for tours, new music projects, or to sell portions of their intellectual property as a way to diversify their investments and sources of income.
